  <h1>🌍 Expieder</h1>
  <p>The social layer for the real world.<br>
  Spatial experiences unfolding in real time and place. <br>
  Where new connections happen outdoors, not on screens.</p>
</header>

<section>
  <h2>👋 A New Way to Connect</h2>
  <p>Expieder is built for a world that craves presence over profiles.<br>
  It's not about scrolling or swiping through feeds, <br>
  it's about stepping outside, exploring, and letting connections unfold naturally.</p>
</section>

  <h2>✨ What is Expieder?</h2>
  <p>Expieder is an Augmented Reality platform that enables spatial social interactions, starting with your smartphone. Pin and discover digital content like messages, media, and profiles; all tied to real-world locations. Whether it's outside your favorite café or along a mountain trail, you leave a part of you behind, and someone else discovers it.</p>

  <h2>🔍 Discover Social Layers Around You</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Explore Instagram posts, reels, and social profiles embedded into your environment.</li>
    <li>Walk through a park and stumble across someone's art.</li>
    <li>Look up and find a pinned Spotify playlist on a rooftop.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><span class="highlight">Social media becomes spatial, woven into the real world.</span></p>

  <h2>🚀 How It Works</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>📍 Spatial Pinning:</strong> Drop messages, media, memories at real-world locations.</li>
    <li><strong>🧭 Explore with AR:</strong> Use your camera to view your surroundings and see content layered in real-time.</li>
    <li><strong>🔗 Social Layer:</strong> Find Instagram, LinkedIn & other social posts, Spotify playlists, public profiles immersed nearby.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>🌱 Why Now?</h2>
  <p>The next generation craves something real:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Same time. Same place.</li>
    <li>No more hiding behind profiles or infinite feeds.</li>
    <li>Experiences that unfold naturally, through the environment.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>And the tech is ready:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Smartphones today</li>
    <li>AR wearables tomorrow</li>
    <li>A new era of spatial computing on the rise</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>🛠 We're Building a New Category</h2>
  <p>This isn’t social media 2.0. This is spatial social exploration:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Content anchored to places</li>
    <li>Shaped by presence</li>
    <li>Alive in real-time moments</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Expieder creates a new medium of communication rooted in movement, space, and context further creating a new market for social exploration outdoors, laying the groundwork for an XR future.</strong></p>

  <h2>🎯 The Vision Ahead</h2>
  <p>We’re not building another social app. We’re building the social layer of the real world, a world where:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Your city becomes your feed</li>
    <li>Your footsteps spark connection</li>
    <li>And being present… means everything</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>❤️ More Than Proximity</h2>
  <p>Dating apps show you who’s nearby. Expieder shows you who’s present.</p>
  <p>In dating and beyond, presence unlocks genuine, time-sensitive interactions, the kind that apps and feeds can’t fake.</p>

  <h2> 🕶 XR Is Coming & We’re Already There</h2>
  <p>Today: On your smartphone.</p>
  <p>Tomorrow: On AR wearables.</p>
  <p>Future: Full mixed-reality social worlds.</p>
  <p>Expieder is laying the foundation for spatial computing, where digital presence lives inside the physical world.</p>

  <h2>🔥 What Makes Expieder Different</h2>
  <p>Others treat AR as a feature , filters, games, or utilities rather than a medium for human connection.</p>
  <p>What they miss: Real-time, location-relevant, time-sensitive interaction is the true unlock.</p>
  <p>Expieder sees AR not just as a visual layer, but a social layer mapped to space and time creating organic, in-person connections.</p>
  <p><strong>📱 We're not building another app to scroll through, we're building a reason to step outside and be present.</strong></p>

  <h2>🌎 A Platform to Form New Connections</h2>
  <p>Connect outdoors. Move, explore, and discover.</p>
  <p>Enjoy Pre-loaded content from day one, you don't have to wait for others to join.</p>
  <p>Your environment is already alive with experiences.</p>

  <h2>🎯 Other Communities Where Expieder Comes to Play</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Gamers: Collaborate outdoors ; from BGMI squads to ludo duels.</li>
    <li>Writers, Poets, Artists: Share creations and connect with like-minded explorers.</li>
    <li>Travellers: Meet others on the same path at the same time.</li>
    <li>Businesses: Display live offers, menus, and events to drive real-world footfall.</li>
  </ul>
