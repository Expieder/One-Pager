    <h2>1. Founder & Startup Background</h2>
    <p>I‚Äôm Mahammad Saddam Hussain, the founder of Xpieder. The idea was born from observing a paradox ‚Äî we live in a hyper-connected world, yet real human connection feels increasingly scarce. Before this, I ran tech-led ventures in education and retail, but I always felt something was missing in how we connect.</p>
    <p>The personal trigger? Watching people share the same physical space, like a caf√© or college campus, but being entirely consumed by digital feeds. I envisioned a world where our environments could talk back ‚Äî not through screens, but through space itself. That seed led to Xpieder.</p>

    <h2>2. Startup Overview</h2>
    <p>Xpieder stands for "Experience + Spider" ‚Äî mapping experiences like a web across physical spaces.</p>
    <p>Founded in 2024 in Assam, Xpieder is a spatial social platform using Augmented Reality to enable people to drop, discover, and interact with digital content anchored in real-world locations.</p>
    <p>Our core mission is simple: To bring presence back to social connection.</p>

    <h2>3. Team</h2>
    <p>I lead product and strategy. Harsh oversees design and user experience, while Rishit leads engineering. We‚Äôre a lean, multidisciplinary team that blends tech, design, and storytelling.</p>
    <p>We look for curiosity, a builder mindset, and a deep belief in real-world impact when hiring.</p>

    <h2>4. Institutional Support</h2>
    <p>Xpieder received early-stage incubation and grant support from Assam Startup and Numaligarh Refinery Ltd. Their backing offered mentorship, network access, infrastructure, and crucial early capital.</p>

    <h2>5. Problem & Solution</h2>
    <p>The problem: Gen Z is the most connected generation, yet the loneliest.</p>
    <p>Today‚Äôs platforms prioritize engagement over presence. Xpieder flips that‚Äîby turning AR into a medium for social interaction, not just a feature.</p>
    <p>You don‚Äôt scroll here. You explore. Connections unfold outdoors, organically, tied to space and time.</p>

    <h2>6. Market</h2>
    <p>Our early adopters are urban Gen Z and college students ‚Äî the ones craving meaningful connections beyond feed culture.</p>
    <p>The AR market is projected to surpass $100B by 2030. Within this, spatial social layers are an emerging category, and we‚Äôre pioneering that space.</p>
    <p>User acquisition starts hyperlocal: we seed content in campuses, parks, and caf√©s to create an explorative loop.</p>

    <h2>7. Business Model</h2>
    <p>We‚Äôre exploring two models:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Freemium ‚Äì with spatial upgrades and exclusive AR content.</li>
      <li>B2B2C ‚Äì Businesses can pin live offers, events, or experiences at physical locations to drive real-world engagement.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Highly scalable through geographic and interest-based expansion.</p>

    <h2>8. Growth & Milestones</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>MVP live for Android and iOS TestFlight</li>
      <li>Strategic advisor onboarded (Sameer Baroova ‚Äì ex-Ola, Y Combinator alum)</li>
      <li>Early pilots in Assam and Delhi</li>
      <li>1000+ organic content pins tested in the field</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>9. Funding</h2>
    <p>Seed-stage: Bootstrapped + Grant of ‚Çπ19 Lakhs from NRL</p>
    <p>Currently exploring pre-seed round with AR/VR-focused global investors like Boost VC</p>

    <h2>10. Competition & Challenges</h2>
    <p>While apps like Snapchat and Niantic play with AR, they use it as an engagement tool.</p>
    <p>Xpieder is different: we treat AR as a communication medium.</p>
    <p>Biggest challenge? Educating users that the future of social isn‚Äôt virtual ‚Äî it‚Äôs spatial.</p>

    <h2>11. Lessons Learned</h2>
    <p>Early hurdle: Building a networked product where experience depends on place.</p>
    <p>Key lesson: Preload the world with content. Make it feel alive, even for the first user.</p>

    <h2>12. Future Plans</h2>
    <p>Short-term: Expand pilot zones and refine AR experiences.</p>
    <p>Long-term: Launch in multiple Indian metros, integrate wearables, and build toward a fully immersive XR platform.</p>

    <h2>13. Impact & Recognition</h2>
    <p>Xpieder redefines how people connect, explore, and express. By encouraging real-world engagement, we‚Äôre addressing digital isolation head-on.</p>
    <p>We‚Äôve been spotlighted by regional innovation platforms and awarded under government-backed startup programs.</p>

    <h2>14. Advice for Aspiring Founders</h2>
    <p>Solve a problem you feel deeply.</p>
    <p>Build for the world ahead, but root yourself in today‚Äôs realities.</p>
    <p>Most importantly ‚Äî build presence, not just product.</p>

  <h1>üåç Expieder</h1>
  <p>The social layer for the real world.<br>
  Spatial experiences unfolding in real time and place. <br>
  Where new connections happen outdoors, not on screens.</p>
</header>

<section>
  <h2>üëã A New Way to Connect</h2>
  <p>Expieder is built for a world that craves presence over profiles.<br>
  It's not about scrolling or swiping through feeds, <br>
  it's about stepping outside, exploring, and letting connections unfold naturally.</p>
</section>

  <section>
  <h2>‚ú® What is Expieder?</h2>
  <p>Expieder is an Augmented Reality platform that enables spatial social interactions, starting with your smartphone. Pin and discover digital content like messages, media, and profiles; all tied to real-world locations. Whether it's outside your favorite caf√© or along a mountain trail, you leave a part of you behind, and someone else discovers it.</p>

  <h2>üîç Discover Social Layers Around You</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Explore Instagram posts, reels, and social profiles embedded into your environment.</li>
    <li>Walk through a park and stumble across someone's art.</li>
    <li>Look up and find a pinned Spotify playlist on a rooftop.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><span class="highlight">Social media becomes spatial, woven into the real world.</span></p>

  <h2>üöÄ How It Works</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>üìç Spatial Pinning:</strong> Drop messages, media, memories at real-world locations.</li>
    <li><strong>üß≠ Explore with AR:</strong> Use your camera to view your surroundings and see content layered in real-time.</li>
    <li><strong>üîó Social Layer:</strong> Find Instagram, LinkedIn & other social posts, Spotify playlists, public profiles immersed nearby.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>üå± Why Now?</h2>
  <p>The next generation craves something real:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Same time. Same place.</li>
    <li>No more hiding behind profiles or infinite feeds.</li>
    <li>Experiences that unfold naturally, through the environment.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>And the tech is ready:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Smartphones today</li>
    <li>AR wearables tomorrow</li>
    <li>A new era of spatial computing on the rise</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>üõ† We're Building a New Category</h2>
  <p>This isn‚Äôt social media 2.0. This is spatial social exploration:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Content anchored to places</li>
    <li>Shaped by presence</li>
    <li>Alive in real-time moments</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Expieder creates a new medium of communication rooted in movement, space, and context further creating a new market for social exploration outdoors, laying the groundwork for an XR future.</strong></p>

  <h2>üéØ The Vision Ahead</h2>
  <p>We‚Äôre not building another social app. We‚Äôre building the social layer of the real world, a world where:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Your city becomes your feed</li>
    <li>Your footsteps spark connection</li>
    <li>And being present‚Ä¶ means everything</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>‚ù§Ô∏è More Than Proximity</h2>
  <p>Dating apps show you who‚Äôs nearby. Expieder shows you who‚Äôs present.</p>
  <p>In dating and beyond, presence unlocks genuine, time-sensitive interactions, the kind that apps and feeds can‚Äôt fake.</p>

  <h2> üï∂ XR Is Coming & We‚Äôre Already There</h2>
  <p>Today: On your smartphone.</p>
  <p>Tomorrow: On AR wearables.</p>
  <p>Future: Full mixed-reality social worlds.</p>
  <p>Expieder is laying the foundation for spatial computing, where digital presence lives inside the physical world.</p>

  <h2>üî• What Makes Expieder Different</h2>
  <p>Others treat AR as a feature , filters, games, or utilities rather than a medium for human connection.</p>
  <p>What they miss: Real-time, location-relevant, time-sensitive interaction is the true unlock.</p>
  <p>Expieder sees AR not just as a visual layer, but a social layer mapped to space and time creating organic, in-person connections.</p>
  <p><strong>üì± We're not building another app to scroll through, we're building a reason to step outside and be present.</strong></p>

  <h2>üåé A Platform to Form New Connections</h2>
  <p>Connect outdoors. Move, explore, and discover.</p>
  <p>Enjoy Pre-loaded content from day one, you don't have to wait for others to join.</p>
  <p>Your environment is already alive with experiences.</p>

  <h2>üéØ Other Communities Where Expieder Comes to Play</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Gamers: Collaborate outdoors ; from BGMI squads to ludo duels.</li>
    <li>Writers, Poets, Artists: Share creations and connect with like-minded explorers.</li>
    <li>Travellers: Meet others on the same path at the same time.</li>
    <li>Businesses: Display live offers, menus, and events to drive real-world footfall.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>üì≤ Start Now</h2>
